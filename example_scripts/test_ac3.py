     """
    Tests all CWL (Common Workflow Language) files in the specified directory by sending them to a given API and 
    recording the response time.

    Args:
        directory (str): Path to the directory containing CWL files.
        api_url (str): URL of the API endpoint to which CWL files will be sent.
        response_file (str): Path to the file where the response times will be logged.

    Returns:
        None

    The function:
        - Iterates over all files in the given directory.
        - For each `.cwl` file, it sends a POST request with the file to the API.
        - Measures the response time for each request.
        - Logs the response times to the specified response file.
        - Tracks the number of files processed in 500ms or less and calculates a success rate.
        - If no CWL files are found, a message is printed to indicate this.
